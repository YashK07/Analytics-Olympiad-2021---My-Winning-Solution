## About

The Academy of Continuing Education at Shiv Nadar University, Delhi-NCR, in partnership with MachineHack, launched the annual Analytics Olympiad for data scientists and machine learning professionals. It was an opportunity for participants to showcase their technical skills and potential in business analytics to prospective employers. 

The competition began on October 21 and was concluded on November 27. The participant who cracked Phase #3 of the challenge won the ‚Çπ1 Lakh/- grand prize. The 1st and 2nd runnerups won ‚Çπ 30,000 and ‚Çπ 20,000 respectively.

The event was a roaring success. The Olympiad received over 1000 registrations from across the country. After undergoing a stringent qualifying round, 250 participants were selected, of which the top ten got an opportunity (I was in the top 10 finalists from the country ‚ú®) to give an in-person presentation at Shiv Nadar University, Delhi NCR before an eminent jury panel. Dr Swati Jain, Vice President, Analytics at EXL; Dr Anish Agarwal, director (data and analytics), NatWest Group; Megha Sinha, Vice President Digital (AI/ML/MLOps), Genpact; and Manoj Madhusudanan, Head of Dunnhumby India formed the jury for the Analytics Olympiad.
